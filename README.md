Cytopia is a free, open source retro pixel-art city building game with a big focus on mods. Love, Cytopia is a port of the original game developed for the LOVE2D framework and written in Lua.

If you have questions or if you want to join the project, visit the [project's Discord server](https://discord.gg/MG3tgYV6ce).

### Supported Platforms

Windows is officially supported, but any platform that can run LOVE2D should support the game too.

### Note

Love, Cytopia is an independent project developed by the lead artist of the original game, Kingtut 101. There are no guarantees that the game will be finished, and the project is not currently accepting contributions from other developers. However, this may change in the future when I have more time.

### Why remake the game instead of contributing to the original?

I'm not as familiar with C++ and I know the original game was difficult to compile and develop. Using Lua and LOVE2D should increase the speed of development and make the code more accessible. This will negatively affect performance, but I think that's worth it. The original game was also very early in development, so it wasn't a big deal starting from scratch.

### Isn't the original project still in development?

Technically, yes. However, the game hasn't received any major updates for years. In addition, most of the original team members have left the project.

### Who are you again?

I joined the original project in late 2018 and have been the lead graphics artist since then. I created most of the environmental and GUI graphics, in addition to the game's logos and name. I was never a developer for the original project, but I was heavily involved with the game's design.

### Why use TheoTown's art style?

This was actually a big accident. Long story short, I used to be a plug-in creator for TheoTown. At some point, the original creator of Cytopia asked to use my graphics for the game. I thought they would be temporary assets, but they ended up becoming permanent parts of the game. By that point, many other artists had joined the project and it was too late to go back. At the end of the day, both games' styles are inspired by SimCity 2000, so it's likely this would've happened regardless.

### Where can I find this game's community?
For now, you should visit the same places you did for the original project.
